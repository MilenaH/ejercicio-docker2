# Instructions:
# 1. Set your Docker Hub username and a token as GitHub secrets: DOCKERHUB_USERNAME and DOCKERHUB_TOKEN.
# 2. On every push to main, this workflow will build and push the Docker image automatically.
# 3. No manual git add/push is needed for the workflow to run; just commit and push as usual.
